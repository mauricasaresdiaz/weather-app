# Weather App
Node JS and Typescript application that provides a REST API to obtain the weather of cities by its name or by its geographic coordinates, obtaining information from external providers.

## Supported providers
- OpenWeatherMap: https://openweathermap.org/

## Run App

### Run App with Docker

To run weather app in a docker container we must follow the following steps:

- Clone proyect

## In Linus Torvalds we trust, all others use lint

A pre-commit git hook was established so when trying to commit changes the lint, test and build scripts will be run to check that everything runs correctly.
